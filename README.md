PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project aims to analyze transactional sales data from multiple Walmart branches to gain valuable business insights and identify patterns in customer purchasing behavior. The dataset includes over 10,000 sales records with attributes such as store location, product category, unit price, quantity, date and time of purchase, payment method, customer ratings, and profit margins. The primary objective is to perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and visualization to uncover key performance indicators (KPIs) for decision-making.

The project involves:

Cleaning and preprocessing the data (e.g., converting prices to numeric, handling missing values).

Analyzing sales trends by city, branch, time of day, and product category.

Investigating the correlation between customer ratings and profit margins.

Examining preferred payment methods and their relationship to sales volume.

Creating visual dashboards and reports to communicate findings.

This analysis supports Walmartâ€™s strategic planning by identifying peak sales periods, high-performing categories, and customer satisfaction trends, thereby helping optimize inventory management, marketing, and pricing strategies.

PROJECT OUTCOME:

Cleaned and structured dataset ready for analysis, with unit prices and quantities correctly formatted and missing data addressed.

Insightful visualizations showing:

Top-selling product categories and their contribution to profit.

Sales distribution across cities and time periods.

Trends in payment preferences and customer satisfaction levels.

Performance comparison of different branches based on revenue and profit margin.

Identification of high-margin categories and time slots with the highest customer traffic.

Actionable recommendations for improving customer experience and maximizing profit.

A comprehensive report/dashboard summarizing key findings for stakeholders.
